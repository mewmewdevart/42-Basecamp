# 42-Basecamp üì¶ 
**42 Ecole - S√£o Paulo:**<br>
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br) is a free Higher Education school with Software Engineering training, where you learn and teach on a 24-hour campus.

## This repository:
This repository was developed so that I could post the coded exercises for me during Basecamp at 42 S√£o Paulo. <br>

‚ùå In the folder [Basecamp_April_2021](https://github.com/mewmewdevart/42-Basecamp/tree/main/Basecamp_April_2021) are the exercises developed by me the first time I participated in the 42 S√£o Paulo selection process. I had some personal problems that hinder my performance during the process. I intend to try to win the vacancy again in 6 months, it's okay to fail.


Just keep swimming...
