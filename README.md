# 42-Basecamp üì¶ 
#### **42 Ecole - S√£o Paulo: üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª**<br>

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. <br>



#### This repository:

This repository was developed so that I could post the coded exercises for me during Basecamp at 42 S√£o Paulo.

‚ùå | In the April/2021 Basecamp folder are the exercises developed the first time I participated in the 42 S√£o Paulo selection process. I failed in the process, plan to try again soon. 



#### Skills developed in 42Basecamp : 

##### HARD SKILLS : [‚öôÔ∏è](https://emojipedia.org/gear/)

- C Language :
  - The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs, including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

- Shell :
  - The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.
- Git :
  - All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to be at ease with such a system.



##### SOFT SKILLS : [‚ö°](https://emojipedia.org/purple-heart/)

- Self-learning and proactiveness :

  - At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

- Teamwork :

  - On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

- Time management and resiliency : 

  - This basecamp was completely online on Discord, so everyone were free to work whenever they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 19-day program.

  

Just keep swimming...
